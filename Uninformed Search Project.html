      <h2>Uninformed Search Project 1<br>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <p>Create a Java project which implements the uninformed
      breadth_first_search algorithm found on page 82 of AIMA
      (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach 3rd edition by Russell
      and Norvig), and uses it to solve the Missionaries and Cannibals
      problem as a first example of a Problem class.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Your project should include the following classes:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Agent -- which includes a breadth_first_search method (page 82 of
      AIM) and a child_node method (page 79 of AIM),</p>
    <p>Problem -- discussed on pages 66 through 68 of AIMA<br>
      Node -- discussed on pages 78 and 79 of AIMA<br>
      Sequence -- mentioned on pages 66 and 67 of AIMA<br>
      QueueFIFO -- discussed on pages 79 and 80 of AIMA<br>
    </p>
    <p>ValidityChecker -- used to make certain that the input is valid<br>
    </p>
    <p>Action -- simple class with a one parameter constructor and a
      toString method<br>
      Percept -- simple class with a one parameter constructor and a
      toString method<br>
      State -- simple class with a one parameter constructor and a
      toString method</p>
    <p>Each of the first six classes mentioned above (Agent, Problem,
      Node, Sequence, QueueFIFO, and ValidityChecker) should have a
      "main" method used for testing the class.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When you implement algorithms from AIMA, use variable names,
      method names, and code structure that are as close as possible to
      the names and structures in AIMA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first Problem we will solve with this AI technique is the
      Missionaries and Cannibals Problem.<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p> In the missionaries and cannibals problem, three
          missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a
          boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint
          that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the
          bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were,
          the cannibals would eat the missionaries).<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem</a></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our encoding scheme is:<br>
    </p>
    <p>Input "M&amp;C#331000#000133" indicates a Missionaries and
      Cannibals Problem with 331000 as a start state and 000133 as a
      goal state.</p>
    <p>"331000" indicates a State with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on
      the left bank of the river, a boat on the left bank, and 0
      missionaries and 0 cannibals on the right bank.</p>
    <p>"120121" indicates a State with 1 missionary and 2 cannibals on
      the left bank of the river, a boat on the right bank, and 2
      missionaries and 1 cannibal on the right bank.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"row#10" indicates an Action where 1 missionary and 0 cannibals
      will move across the river and also the boat will move to the
      other bank.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If <b>s</b> is a State initialized with "331000" and <b>a</b>
      is an Action initialized with "row#10", then&nbsp; <b>result(s,a)</b>
      would return a State initialized with "230110".<br>
    </p>
    <p>Example runs of a completed project will be demonstrated and
      discussed in class.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Note: Using the generalized agent approach developed in AIMA it
      will be possible to add a single new Problem subclass to the
      program and solve other problems from different domains. For
      example, our agent will be able to solve the routeFinding problem
      by adding a new Problem subclass.<br>
